                    with three years dedicated to web development and approximately one year as a mobile developer.

                In terms of my personality, I am an active and sociable individual who easily connects with team members. 
                I have a strong desire to learn and adapt to new technologies, making me a fast and eager learner. I'm also an attentive listener 
                and a well-organized person when it comes to transitioning mockup designs into live applications for detail. 
                Additionally, I am skilled at converting design concepts into clean and high-quality code.
